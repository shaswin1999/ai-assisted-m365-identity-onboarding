## Microsoft Graph API Usage

### Create User
- Method: POST URL: /v1.0/users
- Permission: User.ReadWrite.All (Application)
- Purpose: Automated identity provisioning

### Add User to Security Group
- Method: POST URL: /v1.0/groups/{group-id}/members/$ref
- Permission: GroupMember.ReadWrite.All (Application)
- Purpose: Group-based access assignment

### Design Considerations
- Application permissions used for non-interactive automation
- Least privilege permissions granted
- No delegated permissions required
