## Security and Design Considerations

### Identity & Access
- Users are never granted permissions directly
- All access is assigned via Security Groups
- Conditional Access policies are linked to groups, not users

### Automation
- Power Automate is used strictly as an orchestration layer
- Decision logic is isolated from execution logic

### Secret Management
- Client secrets are stored securely
- No secrets are committed to the repository

### Architectural Intent
The design prioritizes:
- Security
- Auditability
- Extensibility
- Enterprise best practices
